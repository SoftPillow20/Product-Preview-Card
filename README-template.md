### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- I learned how to properly use flexbox. This challenge is easy enough to learn basic stuff while making it responsive that follows an specific device screen size.
- I also used padding instead of margin because I saw how facebook use their padding so I want to see if I can apply that method and it worked perfectly.


### Useful resources

- I mainly use all the resources that was given to me prior when accepting this challenge at Frontend Mentor.
